# Text-and-Statistical-Analysis

1. Text Analysis Program:
This program analyzes user input text by reversing it and determining if itâ€™s a palindrome (a sequence that reads the same forward and backward). It processes each character to check if the reversed text matches the original. If the input is not a palindrome, the reversed string is printed. If the input is a palindrome, the program announces it and displays the reversed text.

2. Statistical Analysis Program:
This program calculates statistical properties such as the mean, standard deviation, and correlation for two sets of user-provided paired float numbers. It first prompts the user to input five pairs of numbers. It then computes the sample means and standard deviations for both sets and finally calculates the correlation coefficient between the two datasets, providing insights into their relationship.
